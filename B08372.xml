            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Reverend, Godly, and worthy Sirs, our Deare Brethren and Companions in the Worke of the <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IF proportionably to the griefe, we have conceived at your Letters (wherein you have expressed the most sad face of your affaires) we had but as much ability either by our Consolations to asswage your Sorrowes, or by our Counsels to ease your Burthens, or by any our Co-operation to help your Extremity, we should thinke our selves very happy in so well corresponding with your honourable, and most loving compellation of us; and right glad we should be thus to requite you with our best and effectuall good offices. But alasse, as the scantnesse of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in this kind, so the Ignorance of the <hi>more inward causes</hi> of so many miseries, and chiefly <hi>the Perplex and dangerous Nature of the Matters now in Agitation among you:</hi> All these put together, strike us quite Dumbe; we are as men wholly at a stand, able onely (in a kind of Silent Astonishment or holy horrour) to admire, and to adore <hi>that Finger of God,</hi> which is now lifted up over you all.</p>
            <p>But since, being by you so lovingly invited to it, we must needs at last breake off our silence, we are reduced to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Suspence both of Mindes and of Pens,</hi> what to say first or last, or indeed what to say at all.</p>
            <p>And now in the end, after long deliberation, least, as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, we should transgresse by precipitate or unseasonable discourse: Behold our Hearts and Monthes top-full of the Sences and Expressions of our hearty Commiseration, our Eyes running down with Teares of Compassion, our Breasts even swolne up with Sighes and Groanes at your Calamities. These are they, God is our Witnesse, that fill up the greatest part of our private Prayers, of our publike Devotions, Fastings, and Humiliations: In all which we are resolved to give <hi>the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:184326:3"/> Father of Mercies</hi> no rest, unrill your Tranquility being once more ordained in Heaven, God doe <hi>extend Peace</hi> upon Earth unto you all like a <hi>River,</hi> and the fulnesse of his <hi>Blessing,</hi> like an ever-flowing <hi>Streame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our affaires, yea, the generall Interest of all the Reformed Churches are so closely involved in yours, and so mutually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending theron, That your safety once procured assures us all of our own good Estates. Therfore especially during this grievous Tempest, which may seem to bring about again the <hi>heavy time of the Saints great Primitive Tribulation,</hi> we are, in a manner, compelled with trembling Hearts and Lipps, to powre out our Lamentations into the Eares of our most gracious &amp; Heavenly Father, no longer now onely preparing to <hi>contend by Fire,</hi> as he once revealed it in a <hi>Vision</hi> to his Prophet<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Amos</hi> 7.4, 5.</note>
               <hi>Amos,</hi> but already for a long time really <hi>contending by Fire</hi> indeed: And how then can we forbeare from crying out, <hi>O Lord forgive, cease we beseech thee, by whom shall</hi> Jacob <hi>arise, for he is</hi> small, <hi>and round about all in a flame, by the fire of thy burning Indignation?</hi> From this our owne <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi> untoucht as yet by Divine miracle: We have beheld this furious Conflagration spreading it selfe all over; We have seen the <hi>Grisoen-Italian Churches</hi> utterly defaced, The Gospell in <hi>Bohemia</hi> its ancient Seat, wholly extirpated: The <hi>Palatinate</hi> devoured; The <hi>French Churches</hi> deprived of all humane supports, and refuges, like so many poore little Callow Birds, alive indeed, but only during pleasure: The <hi>German Churches</hi> almost all overshaken, yea, more then halfe destroyed; your own <hi>Ireland</hi> swallowed up with an unexpected deluge of <hi>Assassines</hi> and <hi>Robbers;</hi> One onely thing was wanting to that huge heape of publike cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Namely, that flourishing <hi>England, the very Eye and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of all the Churches, Christs own choyce, purchase, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar; The Sanctuary of the afflicted, the Arcenall of the faint-hearted, thr Magazins of the Needy, that Royall Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of good hope,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">This is a very large Testimony of the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing Estate of the church of <hi>England</hi> as it stood under its E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> should by so unlookt for an Accident, without any externall enemy, or Forrain Impression, become in a manner, its own <hi>Felo de se,</hi> and make an end of it selfe with its own cruell hands. What a sad Spectacle is this to see that Church thus trodden under foot? To see that glorious
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:184326:4"/> Fould of our Lord thus ransanckt, yea worried, not by the wilde Beasts of the Forrest, not torne in peeces by the Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Pawes of the Lion, or of the Wolfe, but utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by its own unnaturall sheep inraged and exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one against another: An horred example this, and till now never heard of among the reformed Churches! It seems here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore like Christs own true sheep, they were kept tame by the feare of God, united by the same bond of Faith, knit together by the Apprehension of the common enemy, and so long they did both expresse and exercise holily and faithfully their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ity, quiet, and unity amongst themselves; in all which, they preserved themselves from the Rage of the Wolfe by the Christian simplicity of their own good Conditions, by the Innocency of their pious lives, by the Sanctity of their Religion, by the Constant undauntednesse of their holy Faith. <hi>But now we are wholly struck with horror at the Change of that so glorious Face</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Still that was under Episcopacy.</note>
               <hi>of your Church,</hi> whilest we heare at this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance the loud report of those deadly Warrs that are now fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up betwixt the King and his people, to see at Daggers drawing indeed, Brethren against Brethren, Parents against their own Children, Christs Sheep pushing against and goaring their owne Fellowes, nay, their owne Shepheards: At all this we are utterly amazed, and <hi>would scarce have beleeved, That in the selfe same pitched Field, one and the same God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the name of one and the same Mediator, at one and the same time, could be invocated for help on both sides, to shed the blood of those, that for the Major-part</hi> had hitherto by so many cleare Demonstrations in the whole equall course of their lives, equall in their <hi>Piety</hi> towards God, equall in their love and <hi>Loyalty</hi> towards their Country, approved themselves such faithfull and true Brethren one to another. Strange, That these should now against their own Bowells turn all their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like power, far better if imployed in the just punishments of their own treacherous Neighbours, or towards the reliefe of their dearest Brethren, so long bowing the back under the weight of their bondage, and even at the last gaspe for help.</p>
            <p>What marvaile then, if these your cruell distractions have awakened yea, divided even to a variety the judgements and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:184326:4"/> affections too of Christendome? Neither do we ourselves deny but that for a while we did somewhat stagger at, and as it were fluctuate about it; yet that demurre of ours did neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from prejudice against, nor from partiality towards ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, as not being called upon by either, neither publikely nor privately, till now of late in your reference unto us, which we do reckon as no small piece of Honour, since in your esteem our Judgement may seem of so much weight, as able to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance or ballance down either party, both being of such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary quality.</p>
            <p>We have conteined our selves within the bounds of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable judgement, and impartiall charity, towards both Parties, for indeed yee are both Brethren; We have neither way exceeded the compasse of our own measure, but still kept a meane, as rejoycing on the one hand at those good things which we did heare were entertained with the generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of all good men; So on the other hand, we could not but behold with griefe those other <hi>Sinister passages</hi> that in themselues did carry a more fatall appearance. We were <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed</hi> at the<note n="*" place="margin">Without Battell or Bloud-shell.</note> Issue of the <hi>Scottish troubles,</hi> that seemed at first to presage a combustion not unlike this of yours, and yet far sooner quenched, for as by Gods own admirable handi-worke, (So by <hi>the never-enough-magnified of your most gracious King,</hi> and by the Concord of that wary Nation) that fire was in time put out, or ever it d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

At the first report of these your own Commotions, our mindes were possessed with a good hope that all past offences might with the same promptitude and facility be forthwith repaired, and all matters composed: So that what Actions or Counsells should appeare amisse, might by the <hi>Benignity of the best of Princes</hi> be easily redressed, and consequently both Church and Commonwealth without noise or bloodshed be kept in due order: In pursuance of all which we could not but <hi>admire</hi> the happy and glorious beginnings of the Parliament, and <hi>the more then Fatherly affection</hi> of His most gracious Majesty, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by his enacting those Lawes, from which for the time to come, there was a cleare hope of a Government full of equity, and freed from all corruption: <hi>An example not so rare,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:184326:5"/> as indeed singular in this our wild Generation, so fertile of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Powers and Princes.</hi> But all these our goodly hopes were soone blasted by <hi>that Raging Storme and Tempest of popular Tumults among you, that did force away both your most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Prince from His Parliament, as also a great part of the Parliament from it selfe. Since which we have heard indeed of many attempts and enterprises, many Propositions and Projects, but all of them come to nothing, nothing is yet brought to perfection, nothing is yet rightly setled or established.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>The businesse of the Church</hi> might seem the chiefe Object of your care and Sollicitude: If it had been handled and debated at times, and with minds calme and quiet, had the opposite judgements been compared and impartially weighed one with another, such an orderly course might happily have purchased a lasting Peace to your Kingdome, and also rendred unto your Church <hi>that most desired Primitive face of the Apostolicall times</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Such was <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in <hi>its</hi> first <hi>Apostolicall vigour of dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipline and Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the which as at <hi>the Synode of Dort</hi> this very man did both acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge unto <hi>Bishop Carleton</hi> to be the best Forme of Church-Government, and also did heartily wish for it in his own Church; so doth he sufficiently commend the happy effects of it above <hi>pag. 5.</hi> in that full passage of his conteining the <hi>Superlative Praises</hi> of the former flourishing Estate <hi>of the Church of England,</hi> as before these Troubles it stood <hi>under Episcopacy:</hi> The Restauration of which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good Estate, is againe by this Authour at the latter end of this Epistle, <hi>pag. 12.</hi> earnestly wished and prayed for.</note> but behold how quite contrary the Event hath fallen out? for the minds of both sides being averse from, yea, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently bent one against another, this very matter hath proved the great Rock of offence by exasperating the wound and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it wider and wider, by distracting more and more assunder the hearts of each party, distempered enough already through former partiality and discord of affections. Nay if the report be true, <hi>these Church-Distractions have opened a wide gap to so many boysterous and private spirits, which we heare have assumed to themselves the most mischievous Title of Independents,</hi> then which <hi>Destructive Sect</hi> nothing could more undermine, yea, quite overturne the very foundation of the Church.</p>
            <p>Besides all that, We have been extreamely grieved at this,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:184326:5"/> That the <hi>Spirit of Division</hi> hath so plentifully sowne among you his pernicious <hi>Tares</hi> of <hi>Feares and Jealousies,</hi> that they have not onely fructified, but even overgrown all over all manner of <hi>Mutuall Trust,</hi> in despight of so many <hi>Royall Protestations sealed</hi> and bound up with so many most <hi>grievous Imprecations.</hi> But <hi>the very top</hi> and <hi>height</hi> of all our Sorrowes on your behalfes, hath been this, That all that cursed fuell thus heaped on, is now at last kindled into <hi>a bloudy War,</hi> lengthened on both sides by a Multiplication <hi>of deadly feudes:</hi> So that during such an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Combustion, <hi>what ever mens bare words, and never so frequent Protestations otherwise may pretend, yet the Royall Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Power and Dignity cannot but fall into utter contempt: and on the contrary, the licentiousnesse of the most audacious and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse cannot but gather Strength, and outgrow the other:</hi> and then, consequently. Piety must needs decay, mutuall Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity must utterly vanish away, and in stead thereof <hi>a kinde of Savage Disposition,</hi> yea brutish Rage <hi>must needs invade at last the Mindes and Manners of the Men of this Generation,</hi> who in processe of time will no longer looke upon the old Originall Causes that began the War, but rather upon the new mutuall Injuries freshly done, or received in the very Progresse or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the Warr between two Parties divided far more by an odious difference of Reproachfull Names as it were, Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous brands fixed upon each other, then really by the Cause it selfe. It had been far more easie unto us, and all good men else, to deliver our Judgements upon your Case; had <hi>the Major part</hi> of either side differed from the other, either in the more Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall points of Religion, or else dissented about the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Lawes of the Commonwealth; or had either Party been oppressed<note n="b" place="margin">Woe be to them that first began that <hi>Warr</hi> whose <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessity,</hi> yea <hi>Injustice,</hi> strangers themselve can so far off so plainly perceive and condemne too.</note> by the other in a direct way of open Persecution, or had there been an Introduction of Publike Tyranny against the Laws through the basenesse and pusillanimity of the other Party: But as for you, you have aboundant cause of Comfort or Security against all these evills<note n="c" place="margin">To wit, in a faire, quiet, Legall <hi>Parliamentary way,</hi> not in a <hi>Martiall way:</hi> therefore he mentions not at all the power of Armes, but only the Power of the Law.</note> since by vertue of your own
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:184326:6"/> most just and powerfull Laws, <hi>those Laws that already have been Indifferently agreed upon by the generall consent of all Parties concerned,</hi> you may with ease prevent, or put all those foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned evills, which in other Kingdoms may seem almost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable: All these considerations put together, have moved us for a long while seriously to deliberate and advise what might be at last, the best expedient left to procure <hi>an honest and sure Peace</hi> among you. Indeed we have been much <hi>Scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> that <hi>all the Mediations</hi> of severall Kingdoms and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Leagve with you, have been tried and used all in vaine: Howbeit it came into our mind to propound this <hi>one Medium more</hi> whether now at last there be yet any hope to obtain from the <hi>Kings</hi> most gracious Majesty, and from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that of both sides <hi>Ecclesiasticall Persons</hi> may be chosen of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned Trust, and Fame-proofe beyond all suspition, to whom this great businesse may be committed, Namely, that Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the chiefe points now in controversie, they may Chalke out some good way towards <hi>an holy Peace.</hi> But first these <hi>Men</hi> must by Gods good Spirit, themselves be <hi>disposessed of all Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inclinations,</hi> that so they may become fit <hi>Ʋmpires and Trustees</hi> of the Publike Peace, and impartiall <hi>Ambassadours of Reconciliation</hi> between both Parties and also able and Studious too by all their Speeches, Exhortations, and Sacred Obtestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to charme the Hearts th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t on both sides are so obdurate in Warr and Bloudshed. This were the ready way, by thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the <hi>Sacred Censer</hi> in the very middest of these Publike flames to quench all the heart-burnings: for who knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the devout Prayers and holy groanes of Persons Sacred, thus prostrate at the foot-stoole of the Heavenly grace, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power and glory may not break out once more, and shew forth it selfe by moving the hearts of both Parties to lay downe all hatred, and publike enmities. The onely way to procure such sound Counsell of both sides, and to purchase again the precious blessing of a generall Peace, is especially when all humane helps faile to call in the Divine Assistance, which no man did ever try in vaine. By these good means that may be brought to passe (what cannot be hoped for from Civill Warr, however the successe prove) that by a voluntary Inclination of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:184326:6"/> Mindes, the wound shall be so fully closed up, as that Love and Charity may in time perfectly be recovered.</p>
            <p>The good opinion which you have conceived of us may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to offer these Considerations unto you. It might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty in us to prescribe, or to advise you any further: But no Law of Modesty can ever forbid us to wish, and to Vow, and to beseech God for you, yea to appeale unto God, and to adjure you all in his Name.</p>
            <p>O then above all, take <hi>a speedy and speiall care for a sure and sound Peace,</hi> what ever it be<note n="d" place="margin">What would this <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker</hi> have said if he had seen or heard of <hi>so many Royall rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of peace</hi> wherwith the Soveraigne hath and still doth wooe his <hi>Stiffe-neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Subjects.</hi> Certainely, <hi>the more peaceable side</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst good men had the Reputation of the better side.</note> 'tis to be preferred before any Civill Broyles.

               <note n="e" place="margin">This was very good Counsell from a <hi>Stranger,</hi> had the Subjects had the grace to follow it in time then had there been an end of <hi>the old Warr,</hi> and a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Prevention of a new Warr,</hi> which except stopt by timely submission can por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend nothing but the utter <hi>Nationall Ruine</hi> of Church and State, which God in mercy avert.</note> TO PINACLES AND PRECIPICES.</p>
